# commodore64-ransomware
Concept of a possible ransomware in the 80s of a commodore64

# The idea

Playing with commodore 64, I've found some special keyboard registers in basic. The concept is a what if, where a user is infected with a virus transmitted with a game floppy that blocks his commodore 64.
Obviusly this is more like a joke but real ransomware are bad so watch out.

# The source code

Check ransomware.bas for the code of the "ransomware". As for the code itself mostly it is just graphics aspects like 53280 and 53281 register make the inner and outer window black and the 646 register puts the text color to green like the classic hacker bad movies. Since there was no internet back then or only BBS, the only thing was calling someone since no blockhain wallet exist. Then the ransomware itself blocks the keyboard input so that the user can not use the commodore and finally a loop so that there's no back to commodore input.
