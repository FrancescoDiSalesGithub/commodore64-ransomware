# commodore64-ransomware
Concept of a possible ransomware in the 80s of a commodore64

# The idea

Playing with commodore 64, I've found some special keyboard registers in basic. The concept is a what if where a user is infected with a virus transmitted with a game floppy that blocks his commodore 64.
Obviusly this is more like a joke but real ransomware are bad so watch out.
